# FMCG Unit Transformation

**Overview:**  
The FMCG unit focuses on packing consumer products into pouches and tins. Originally, it required 36 Packing Assistants and three Supervisors, resulting in high overhead costs and inefficient resource usage.

**Steps Taken:**  
- Implemented a piece-rate pay model, eliminating the need for 36 Packing Assistants.
- Trained Operators to take on extra responsibilities, reducing Supervisors from 3 to 2.
- Assigned one person on general shift to handle SAP entries, inventory, and daily reports.
- Introduced modular racking to boost storage capacity by 40%.
- Adopted demand-buffer inventory planning to ensure smooth production in all seasons.

**Results:**  
- Significant cost savings through reduced headcount and overhead.
- Continuous profitability, even in off-season periods.
- No idle manpower or resource waste.
