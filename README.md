# FMCG-Unit-Transformation

**FMCG Packing Unit**

The unit focuses on packing consumer products into pouches and tins. The staffing structure includes three Packing Supervisors (one per shift), three Operators (one per shift), and 36 Packing Assistants (12 per shift). Currently, overall sales versus costs are at break-even or show negative performance during off-seasons.

**Steps Taken:**

- Organised a packing contract on a piece-rate basis, eliminating the need for 36 Packing Assistants.
- Provided training for Operators to enable them to take on additional responsibilities, reducing the number of Supervisors from three to two.
- Assigned one person for the general shift to prepare daily reports, manage inventory and stocks, and make necessary entries in SAP on a daily basis.
- Introduced a racking system to optimise storage space for materials within the existing unit.
- The FMCG packing unit operates based on demand, with buffer stocks maintained to ensure efficiency.

Since implementing these changes, there has been no idle manpower or waste of resources. The unit has consistently achieved profitability in both peak and off-seasons.
